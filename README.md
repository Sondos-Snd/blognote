- **Read the README**: The README file contains essential information about the project, including how to set it up locally and contribute. It's your first stop!

#### **2. Fork and Clone the Repository** 🍴
- **Fork the Repo**: Click on the **"Fork"** button in the top-right corner to create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.
- **Clone the Repo**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine using:
  ```bash
  git clone <your-forked-repo-url>
  cd blognote
  ```

#### **3. Set Up Your Local Environment** 🛠️
- **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install all necessary dependencies for both the front-end (Angular) and back-end (Spring Boot).
- **Run the Project**: Start the development server and make sure everything is working as expected:

- **Discuss**: Place the issue/feature under **"Doing"** tab to let everyone know you're working on it. This helps prevent overlapping efforts.
